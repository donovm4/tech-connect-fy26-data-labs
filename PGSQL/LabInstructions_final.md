## Overview

In this lab, you'll plan and execute a migration of a representative Linux workload from an on-premises datacenter to **Microsoft Azure**. You'll use **Azure Migrate** to discover and assess the environment, choose modernization paths, and then migrate both a database tier (PaaS) and an application tier (IaaS).

## Case study: Linux Migrate

**Terra Firm Laboratories** is a global bioengineering company and a leading researcher in genetic and biological science technology. Founded in 1975, Terra Firm's headquarters are in Palo Alto, CA. Mission-critical workloads are currently hosted in an on-premises datacenter, and the organization is beginning a journey to modernize and migrate into the cloud using Microsoft Azure.

The CTO, **Dennis Nedry**, has initiated an effort to adopt Azure and modernize infrastructure by reducing technical debt and streamlining operations using **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** and **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** capabilities. Terra Firm completed an initial analysis across more than 250 workloads and selected one workload to validate the migration plan end-to-end. The environment includes multiple Linux distributions (RHEL, SUSE, Ubuntu, and a Debian-based custom distro). The company currently uses **FreeIPA** for identity management and wants to migrate to **Microsoft Entra ID**.

## Architecture

In this lab, you work with:

- An on-premises-style **Hyper-V host** running Linux virtual machines.
- Two **Azure Migrate projects** used to discover servers, workloads and generate assessments and further migrate
- A **PaaS target** for PostgreSQL using **Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server** (private access).
- An **IaaS target** using **Azure VM migration** (Azure Migrate Server Migration).

## Exercises

This lab includes the following exercises:

- **Exercise 01**: Prepare for workload migration with Azure Migrate 
- **Exercise 02**: Assess on-prem workload readiness for migration 
- **Exercise 03**: Migrate PostgreSQL to Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server 
- **Exercise 04**: Migrate Linux middleware using Azure Migrate

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with the **Azure portal** (resource groups, search, blades).
- Comfort using a browser-based lab environment and switching between tabs/windows.
- Basic Linux navigation concepts (you'll use provided commands and credentials).
- Basic understanding of migration concepts:
  - Discovery and assessment
  - Cutover and validation
  - Rollback and operational readiness

# Exercise 01: Prepare for workload migration with Azure Migrate

## Introduction

This exercise establishes the Azure Migrate foundation for the lab. You'll create two dedicated Azure Migrate projects:

- You'll configure discovery in one project based on output from a Offline Discovery so that Azure Migrate can detect both server inventory and workload-level objects. The discovered data from this import becomes the source data for a later business case and assessment.
- The second project will focus on the agent-based migration of an on-premises application-tier virtual machine to Azure.

## Description

In this exercise, you'll:

- Sign in to the Azure portal and create two Azure Migrate projects in the provided subscription and resource group.
- Import the ZIP file generated by a Disconnected Appliance
- Configure the Azure Site Recovery Provider for agent-based replication and migration

## Success criteria

- 2 Azure Migrate projects exist and can be opened successfully.
- The Hyper-V server begins to register to the project and is on it's way to showing a successful/healthy registration status
- Azure Migrate begins to populate discovered inventory with the expected servers and workload objects.

## Key tasks
- Create and open the Azure Migrate projects that will serve as the workspaces for discovery, assessment, and migration activities.
- Import the offline discovery file.
- Configure the Hyper-V host to enable workload identification for replication and migration.

# Exercise 02: Business Case and Assessment

## Introduction

This exercise turns discovery data into actionable migration planning outputs. You'll generate a business case to estimate projected costs and savings, and review the assessment created automatically from that business case to understand readiness and migration recommendations. You'll also define an application so you can reason about the system as a single unit (frontend + backend + workloads), compare PaaS vs IaaS paths, and build a wave plan that sequences migration work. Finally (and optionally), you'll perform identity planning by mapping FreeIPA identities to Microsoft Entra ID targets to support secure administration and application access after migration.

## Description

In this exercise, you'll:

- Build a business case scoped to the lab environment and review its outputs (scope, cost comparison, savings, and strategy summaries).
- Explore discovered inventory to confirm servers and workloads were detected.
- Define an application for a stack by linking the frontend and backend servers and their discovered workloads.
- Review the assessment created by the business case and compare modernization options (PaaS preferred, PaaS only, lift-and-shift to Azure VMs).
- Create a wave plan from the recommended path, add tasks, review selected applications/workloads, and inspect target settings and migration options.
- Optionally document a planning-only identity mapping strategy from FreeIPA to Microsoft Entra ID, including admins, users, and service identities.

## Success criteria
- A business case named **bc-@lab.LabInstance.Id** exists and reflects the expected scope (workloads/web apps/databases).
- The assessment **businesscase-bc-@lab.LabInstance.Id** is accessible, shows the expected workload count, and provides clear path comparisons across PaaS and IaaS options.
- An application named **airsonic-app-@lab.LabInstance.Id** exists and includes the linked servers and discovered workloads.
- A wave plan named **wave-@lab.LabInstance.Id** exists and includes the Airsonic application and expected workloads, with tasks and target settings reviewed.
- A FreeIPA-to-Entra identity mapping table is completed with at least six entries covering admin, user, and service identities.

## Key tasks
- Generate a business case and interpret its cost/savings outputs while validating the scope matches discovered inventory.
- Create an application definition for the Airsonic stack so planning reflects an application boundary rather than individual servers.
- Use the assessment to compare PaaS vs IaaS paths and identify recommended targets for the web app and PostgreSQL database.
- Create a wave plan from the recommended path, add migration tasks, and review workload selection and target settings.
- Document a practical identity mapping strategy from FreeIPA to Entra ID to support post-migration administration and access control.

===

## Task 01: Build a Business case and Assessment

### Introduction
Dennis needs a lot more to get Terra Firm's cloud initiative funded - he needs a story backed by numbers. The business case turns discovered inventory into a cost-and-savings view, helping Terra Firm evaluate things like Azure Hybrid Benefit, operational savings, and what "moving efficiently" could actually look like.

### Description
In this task, you'll build a business case scoped to the environment and confirm it begins generating. While it runs, you'll explore the discovered inventory and validate that key workloads have been discovered.

### Success criteria
- A business case named **bc-@lab.LabInstance.Id** is created and visible under **Decide and Plan > Business cases**.
- Discovered inventory is visible in the project and includes the expected servers and workloads.

### Key tasks
- Start **Build business case** using the specified settings (target location, modernization preference, pricing assumptions).
- Open **Explore inventory** and validate discovered servers and discovered workloads (web app + database).
- Drill into at least one database workload and one web app workload to review details.

1. [] In the Azure portal, search for +++Azure Migrate+++ in the search bar and select **Azure Migrate**, under **Services**.

    ![Azure Migrate is displaed in the Azure Search bar and highlighted in the search results.](instructions312691/17-AzureMigrate.png)

1. [] On the **Azure Migrate Project** blade in the offline Azure portal, expand the **Decide and Plan** in the left menu, then select **Business cases**. Further select **Build business case** in the main page

1. [] Enter +++bc-@lab.LabInstance.Id+++ for the Business case name, then select **Entire datacenter**.

	!IMAGE[k6lmul2t.jpg](instructions332284/k6lmul2t.jpg)

1. [] On the **Build business case (Preview)** page, enter the following:

    | Object | Value |
    | -------- | -------- |
    | Target location | **@lab.CloudResourceGroup(AZMigrateRG).Location**| 
    | Migration preference | **Modernize**| 
    | Migration preference | **Reserved Instance**| 
    | Discount (%) on Pay as you go | **0**| 
    | Currency | **US Dollar ($)**| 

1. [] Select **Build business case**.

	>[!Note] The business case will take approximately 10 minutes to generate. You can continue with the lab while it is generating.

	>[!Note] Building a business case automatically creates an assessment as well. You'll evaluate both when the generation is complete.

## Explore the discovered inventory

1. [] On the Azure Migrate blade, select **All projects**, and then select the **Migration-Project-@lab.LabInstance.Id** project.

1. [] On the left navigation menu, expand **Explore Inventory**.

1. [] Select **All inventory** and then observe the discovered objects.

    !IMAGE[qlk59gmg.jpg](instructions332284/qlk59gmg.jpg)

You initiated a business case for the environment and verified the discovered inventory contains the expected servers and workload objects used for planning.

===

## Task 02: Define an application for the Airsonic stack

### Introduction
Terra Firm isn't migrating "random servers" - they're migrating a workload that users rely on, with tiers that rise and fall together. Defining the application lets Dennis's team treat the pilot as a single unit (web/app/database), making it easier to plan dependencies, choose a target approach, and avoid migrating pieces out of order.

### Description
In this task, you'll create an application definition for the Airsonic stack by linking the frontend and backend servers and their discovered workloads (Tomcat web app and PostgreSQL database). You'll also set basic app properties such as business criticality and complexity.

### Success criteria
- An application named **airsonic-app-@lab.LabInstance.Id** exists in **Explore applications > Applications**.
- The application includes the linked Airsonic servers and their discovered workloads.

### Key tasks
- Create a new **Custom** application definition from **Explore applications > Applications**.
- Link the Airsonic frontend and backend servers (ensuring workloads are included).
- Set business criticality/complexity values and create the application.

You're grouping the Airsonic Frontend + Backend + discovered workloads (Tomcat + PostgreSQL) into one "application" so you can assess, plan waves, and make PaaS vs IaaS decisions as a stack.

1. [] In the left menu under **Explore applications**, select **Applications**.

1. [] Select **+ Define application**.

1. [] For the Name, enter +++airsonic-app-@lab.LabInstance.Id+++.

1. [] For the description, enter +++Airsonic application consists of a front end Java/Tomcat app and a back end PostgreSQL database+++.

1. [] For Type, select **Custom**.

1. [] Select **Next**.

1. [] Select **Link workloads**.

1. [] Select the checkboxes next to **Airsonic-Frontend** and **Airsonic-Backend**.

	>[!Note] Selecting the servers will also select the Web app and Database workloads.

    !IMAGE[y7vhs9bj.jpg](instructions332284/y7vhs9bj.jpg)

1. [] Select **Add**.

1. [] On the Workloads tab, select **All four workloads**, and then select **Next**.

	!IMAGE[a697m390.jpg](instructions332284/a697m390.jpg)

1. [] On the properties tab, enter the following:

    | Object | Value |
    | -------- | -------- |
    | Business criticality | **Medium** |
    | Complexity | **Medium** |
    | Publisher | **Blank** |
    | Technology stack | **Blank** |

1. [] Select **Review and Create**, and then select **Create**.

	>[!Note] **Refresh** your browser tab until you see that the application has been created.

#### Congratulations! 
You grouped the Airsonic stack into a single application, including its servers and discovered workloads, so it can be assessed and planned as a unit.

===

## Task 03: Review the Business Case outputs (scope, savings, and data quality)

### Introduction
Terra Firm's leadership will ask tough questions-especially about savings, scope, and whether the numbers are trustworthy. Reviewing the business case outputs helps Dennis confirm the pilot workload is correctly represented and that the cost/savings story is grounded in accurate discovery data (because "garbage in, garbage out" applies to cloud planning too).

### Description
In this task, you'll open the generated business case and review key outputs including scoped item counts, estimated costs and savings, and the migration strategy summary. You'll verify that the scope aligns with the discovered inventory.

### Success criteria
- Scoped item counts align with lab inventory (workloads, web apps, database).
- You can locate and interpret key cost and savings outputs and a migration strategy summary.

### Key tasks
- Open the business case overview and review costs, savings, and the YOY visualization.
- Verify scoped item counts match the discovered inventory in the lab.
- Review **Current on-premises vs future** and **Migration Strategies** reports and compare major outputs.

1. [] In the Azure Migrate project, under **Decide and Plan**, select **Business cases**.

	>[!Alert] The Business case generation must be complete before you can continue. If it has not completed, you must wait.

1. [] Select **bc-@lab.LabInstance.Id**.

1. [] On the **Overview** page, observe the **Potential cost savings**:

    - Estimated on-premises cost
    - Estimated Azure cost
    - Savings
    
    !IMAGE[upkfkq7n.jpg](instructions332284/upkfkq7n.jpg)

1. [] On the **Overview** page, observe the **YOY current vs future state costs**:

	!IMAGE[3gim64n3.jpg](instructions332284/3gim64n3.jpg)

1. [] Under **Scoped items**, verify that:
 
    - Workloads = **4**
    - WebApps = **1**
    - Database = **1**

	!IMAGE[cswnbno4.jpg](instructions332284/cswnbno4.jpg)

1. [] On the left menu under **Business Case Reports**, select **Current on-premises vs future**.

1. [] Analyze the **On-premises vs Azure cost**.

1. [] Scroll down and compare the **Total cost of ownership** per object. 

1. [] On the left menu under **Business Case Reports**, select **Migration Strategies.** and then review the following sections:

    !IMAGE[jiabw3sq.jpg](instructions332284/jiabw3sq.jpg)
    !IMAGE[h3xgnmxa.jpg](instructions332284/h3xgnmxa.jpg)

1. [] Select the **X** in the top right corner to close the Business Case.

#### Congratulations!
You reviewed business case scope and cost outputs to understand projected on-prem vs Azure costs, savings, and strategy assumptions based on discovered data.

===

## Task 04: Review the Assessment created by the Business Case

### Introduction
Terra Firm wants options: lift-and-shift where it makes sense, but also modernization paths that reduce long-term work and improve security. The assessment translates discovery into readiness and recommendations, so Dennis can compare VM migration versus PaaS/container options and choose what best fits the pilot's needs.

### Description
In this task, you'll open the assessment created by the business case and compare recommendations across **PaaS preferred**, **PaaS only**, and **Lift and shift to Azure VM** views. You'll observe how targets and readiness differ by path.

### Success criteria
- The assessment shows **4 workloads** and uses the **Modernize** preference.
- You can identify the recommended target approach for the web app and database across the different paths.

### Key tasks
- Open the assessment produced by the business case and verify workload count and migration preference.
- Compare the migration paths across **PaaS preferred**, **PaaS only**, and **Lift and shift**.
- Use **View details** to identify the recommended target services for the app tier and database tier.


1. [] In the Azure Migrate project, under **Decide and Plan**, select **Assessments**.

1. [] Select the **businesscase-bc-@lab.LabInstance.Id** assessment.

1. [] Ensure that **4** Workloads are displayed and that the Migration preference is set to **Modernize**.

	!IMAGE[c4l7amcd.jpg](instructions332284/c4l7amcd.jpg)

1. [] Select the **X** in the top right corner to close the assessment page.

#### Congratulations! 
You compared modernization options and validated the recommended migration approach for the web app and PostgreSQL workload across PaaS and IaaS paths.

===

## Task 05: Create a wave plan using the recommended path

### Introduction
One of Terra Firm's biggest worries is downtime, so "move everything at once" is not ideale. Wave planning helps Dennis break migration into manageable phases, align tasks and dependencies, and create an execution plan that supports faster delivery *and* safer rollback decision points.

### Description
In this task, you'll create a wave from the assessment's recommended path and then review wave settings, tasks, selected applications/workloads, and target settings. You'll confirm the wave includes the Airsonic application and the discovered workloads.

### Success criteria
- A wave plan named **wave-@lab.LabInstance.Id** exists under **Decide and Plan > Wave planning**.
- The wave includes the Airsonic application and the expected workloads, and you can review its target settings and migration options.

### Key tasks
- Create a wave plan directly from the assessment's **Recommended path**.
- Add at least two custom tasks to the wave and save changes.
- Review application/workload selections, target settings, and migration options associated with the wave.

## Task 06: Map identity from FreeIPA to Microsoft Entra ID (Optional)

### Introduction
Terra Firm currently relies on FreeIPA, but Dennis wants the future to run on Microsoft Entra ID, without breaking access for admins, apps, or service accounts. Mapping identity up front prevents post-migration surprises (like nobody being able to sudo) and sets the groundwork for consistent access control and auditability in Azure.

### Description
In this task, you'll document an identity mapping strategy from FreeIPA to Microsoft Entra ID. You'll identify identity categories used by the workloads and create a mapping table that includes admins, application users, and service identities.

### Success criteria
- Identity categories relevant to the migrated workloads are documented.
- A mapping table with at least **6** entries is completed, showing FreeIPA identities and planned Entra targets and usage.

### Key tasks
- Identify the FreeIPA identity categories used by Linux, application, and database administration.
- Create a mapping table that includes admins, app users, and service accounts.
- Document where each mapped identity will be used after migration (SSH/sudo, DB roles, app authorization, secrets).


You won't migrate identity in this exercise. Instead, you'll document a mapping strategy that supports the migrated Linux and application environment.

Using notepad or a piece of paper, document the following:

1. [] What identity categories that exist in **FreeIPA** for your workloads:

    - Linux administrators
    - Application administrators
    - Database administrators
    - Application users
    - Service accounts (Tomcat-to-PostgreSQL connection identity)

1. [] Create a mapping table in your notes and add at least 6 entries:

| FreeIPA user/group | Purpose | Entra ID target (user/group) | Where used after migration |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| ipaadmins | Linux admin access | Linux-Admins | SSH/sudo |
| dbadmins | DB admin | Airsonic-DB-Admins | DB roles |
| appadmins | App admin | Airsonic-App-Admins | App authorization |
| svc_airsonic | App→DB connection | (planned service identity) | App config/secrets |
| user01 | App user | user01 | AppUsers group |
| user02 | App user | user02 | AppUsers group |

#### Congratulations! 
You documented a FreeIPA-to-Entra identity mapping plan that identifies key users, groups, and service identities required to operate the migrated workload securely.

# Exercise 03: Migrate on-premises PostgreSQL 

### Introduction
Terra Firm doesn't want sensitive database traffic exposed, and they prefer private endpoints whenever possible. Establishing VPN connectivity gives the lab environment a secure path into Azure so the team can reach private resources (like the PostgreSQL service) during migration and validation-without punching public holes in the design.

### Description
In this task, you'll run the provided PowerShell script to establish VPN connectivity. You'll authenticate using device sign in and confirm the connection remains active for subsequent steps.

### Success criteria
- Device sign in authentication completes successfully for the VPN connection.
- The VPN connection remains active for later tasks that require private connectivity.

### Key tasks
- Run the VPN automation script and confirm the script completes
- Connect to and modify some Airsonic application data
- Retrieve the internal IP address of the Flexible PostgreSQL server
- Migrate the on-premises PostgreSQL Server to Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible server
- Update the web server

===

## Task 01: Connecting the Site-to-Site VPN

1. [] Minimize the browser and locate the **HV-AutomateClientVPNSconnect.ps1** file on the desktop.

    !IMAGE[yd4e9zdv.jpg](instructions332284/yd4e9zdv.jpg)

1. [] Right select on the file and then select **Run with PowerShell**.

1. [] Wait until you see the prompt to sign in using a web browser. **Copy the code** from the PowerShell window.

	!IMAGE[breubrz1.jpg](instructions332284/breubrz1.jpg)

1. [] Open a new browser tab and connect to +++microsoft.com/devicelogin+++.

1. [] **Paste the code**, and then select **Next**.

1. [] Select **@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Username**, and then select **Continue**.

1. [] Once signed in, close the browser tab and return to the PowerShell window.

1. [] At the Select a subscription prompt, select **Enter** to use the default.

	>[!Note] You can safely minimize the PowerShell window while it connects the VPN.

#### Congratulations! 
You established hybrid connectivity from the lab environment to Azure so private endpoints and internal Azure resources can be reached during migration and validation.

===

## Task 02: Connect to and update the Airsonic application

1. [] Open a new browser tab and connect to +++http://airsonic-frontend:8080/airsonic+++.

1. [] Login using +++admin+++ for the username and +++admin+++ for the password.

### Customize the interface in order to identify the database after the migration.

1. [] On the left menu under **Playlists**, select **Create new playlist**.

1. [] Select the newly create playlist (the name will default to today's date).

1. [] Select **Edit**, and then enter a **Unique name** for the playlist.

	>[!Alert] It may take a minute before you are able to select the **Edit** option, please be patient. 

1. [] In the top menu, select **Settings**, and then select **Database**.

	>[!Note] Notice that the application is currently pointing to 192.168.1.165 for the PostgreSQL database. That is the address of the on-prem server hosting the database.

    !IMAGE[08drk342.jpg](instructions332284/08drk342.jpg)

1. [] In the top right corner, select **Log out**.

	!IMAGE[4jo6v3al.jpg](instructions332284/4jo6v3al.jpg)

1. [] Close the airsonic browser tab.

1. [] Return to the Azure portal and confirm that your PostgreSQL Flexible Server deployment is complete.

	>[!Note] If the deployment has not completed, wait for it to finish before you continue to the next step.

#### Congratulations! 
You created an identifiable marker in the application and confirmed the pre-migration database endpoint so you can clearly validate the migration outcome later.

===

## Task 03: Retrieve the internal IP address of the Flexible PostgreSQL server

### Introduction
Because Terra Firm is using private access, the database endpoint needs to resolve correctly inside the private network - not out on the public internet. Pulling the internal IP (via Private DNS) helps the team confirm name resolution and connectivity are behaving as intended before they point production-like workloads at the new database.

### Description
In this task, you'll locate the private DNS record for the flexible server and record the internal IP address. This value will be used for application connectivity configuration later in the lab.

### Success criteria
- The private DNS record for the flexible server is located successfully.
- The flexible server internal IP address is recorded in the lab textbox.

### Key tasks
- Open **Private DNS zones** and locate the zone/records related to the flexible server.
- Identify the **A record** for the flexible server and record its IP address.
- Store the IP address for use in subsequent configuration steps.

1. [] In the Azure portal search bar, search for and then select +++Private DNS zones+++.

1. [] Select the Private DNS zone that begins with **pgsql-flex-@lab.LabInstance.Id.xxxxxxxx**.

1. [] Select the number that appears under **Recordsets** (2).

	!IMAGE[55fvhdc0.jpg](instructions332284/55fvhdc0.jpg)

1. [] Locate the record that appears as **Type A** and enter the value for the IP address in the text box below:

	 @lab.TextBox(FlexIP)

	>[!Note] This is the internal IP address assigned to the Flexible PostgreSQL server. You'll use this in a later exercise.

1. [] Select the **X** in the top right corner of the window, to close the Private DNS zone flyout.

#### Congratulations! 
You located the private DNS record for the flexible server and recorded its internal IP address for use in application configuration and connectivity validation.

===

## Task 04: Validate and migrate the database

### Introduction
Dennis wants to accelerate migration, but not by skipping safety checks. Running validation first helps Terra Firm catch problems early (permissions, connectivity, compatibility) so the actual migration is smoother, and it supports the customer's rollback concerns by reducing the chance of a failed cutover.

### Description
In this task, you'll run a validation migration job, review results for errors, and then run an offline database migration to PostgreSQL flexible server. You'll monitor both jobs until they succeed.

### Success criteria
- The validation job completes successfully with no blocking errors.
- The migration job completes with status **Succeeded** for the Airsonic database.

### Key tasks
- Create and run a **Validate** migration job using the Migration Service for PostgreSQL.
- Review validation output for errors/warnings and confirm readiness.
- Create and run a **Validate and migrate** offline migration job and monitor status to completion.

===

## Task 05: Verify the database migration

### Introduction
A successful migration isn't "the tool said Succeeded" - it's "the app still works and the data is intact." This verification step lets Terra Firm prove the pilot workload is using the new Azure database and that the pre-migration marker data is still there, exactly the kind of confidence Dennis needs before scaling this approach to more workloads.

### Description
In this task, you'll update the Airsonic configuration to point to the migrated database, reboot the application server, and verify the app works and displays the pre-migration marker data.

### Success criteria
- The Airsonic app starts successfully after configuration changes and reboot.
- You can log in and confirm the pre-migration marker (playlist) is present.
- The database settings reflect the new database endpoint after migration.

### Key tasks
- Update the Airsonic database connection configuration to use the flexible server endpoint.
- Reboot the Airsonic server and wait for the service to become available.
- Log in to Airsonic and confirm functionality and expected data after migration.

## Exercise 04: Replicate and Migrate Airsonic-Frontend

## Task 01: Replicate the RHEL VM (Airsonic-Frontend)

### Introduction
Terra Firm's downtime question is front and center: "How long will we be offline?" Replication is one of Dennis's best answers - by keeping Azure up to date with ongoing changes, the team can cut over using the latest data instead of doing a massive copy during the outage window.

### Description
In this task, you'll start replication for the Airsonic-Frontend VM, apply assessment-based settings, and monitor progress until replication is in a protected state.

### Success criteria
- Replication is started for **Airsonic-Frontend**.
- Replication status reaches **Protected**.

### Key tasks
- Start the **Replicate** workflow for Hyper-V VMs and select assessment-based settings.
- Configure target settings (RG, VNet/subnet, cache storage, availability) and VM compute sizing.
- Monitor replication jobs until the VM shows **Protected**.

## Task 02: Migrate the RHEL VM

### Introduction
This is the "go time" moment Terra Firm worries about most - moving the workload without surprises. A planned migration uses the latest replicated data for a controlled cutover, helping Dennis demonstrate a predictable process and making it easier to justify scaling the approach across the rest of the environment.

### Description
In this task, you'll initiate a planned migration for the replicated Airsonic-Frontend VM and monitor the migration job until it completes.

### Success criteria
- A planned migration completes successfully for Airsonic-Frontend.
- The migrated VM is created in Azure and starts successfully.

### Key tasks
- Confirm replication is protected and initiate **Migrate** (planned failover) from the replication item.
- Approve shutdown of the on-premises VM for a no-data-loss cutover.
- Monitor the migration job until it completes successfully.

1. [] In the Azure portal, return to the **Migration-Project-@lab.LabInstance.Id** Project page, expand **Execute** in the left menu, select **Migrations**, and on the Migration blade, select **Replications summary**.

1. [] Start the migration by selecting the ellipsis to the right of the **Airsonic-Frontend** item, and then select **Migrate** from the context menu.

1. [] Select **Yes** to shutting down the VM and performing a planned migration with no data loss.

1. [] Select **Migrate** to begin the migration process.

    >[!Note] The migration process will take approximately 15 minutes.

#### Congratulations! 
You performed a planned migration cutover to create and start the Azure VM using the latest replicated data with minimal risk of data loss.

===

## Task 03: Finalize the migration

### Introduction
Once Terra Firm confirms the pilot VM runs correctly in Azure, there's no need to keep paying for (or managing) replication state. Stopping replication cleans up the migration workflow, and validating the workload end-to-end gives Dennis the proof point the business wants: the app is reachable, functional, and behaving as expected after the move.

### Description
In this task, you'll stop replication for the migrated VM and validate the workload by accessing the Airsonic application hosted on the migrated Azure VM.

### Success criteria
- Replication is stopped and replication state is cleaned up for Airsonic-Frontend.
- The Airsonic application is accessible on the Azure VM and shows expected content.

### Key tasks
- Review migration job completion and confirm planned failover finished successfully.
- Stop replication for the migrated VM to clean up replication state.
- Locate the VM in Azure, record the private IP, and validate application access via browser.

## Stop replication on the migrated VM

1. You can monitor the progress by opening the **Jobs** section on the Migration blade and selecting **Planned failover**.

    ![The Jobs page is displayed with the active and completed jobs shown in a list.](instructions312691/55-jobs.png)

    ![Screenshot of the Planned failover job details.](instructions312691/56-PlannedFailover.png)

	>[!Note] When the migration completes, the status will display **Planned failover finished**
 
1. [] Stop the replication by right-clicking the VM, and selecting **Stop replication**. This action:

    - Stops replication for the on-premises machine.
    - Removes the machine from the Replicated servers count in the Migration and modernization tool.
    - Cleans up replication state information for the VM.

## Confirm the migrated VM functionality

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select +++Virtual machines+++.

	>[!Note] You should see the migrated VM running in your inventory.

1. [] Select the **Airsonic-Frontend** VM.

1. [] On the left menu, under **Networking**, select **Network settings**.

1. [] Locate the **Private IP address** and enter it into the text box below: 
	 
     @lab.TextBox(MigratedIP)

     !IMAGE[utw8ql6y.jpg](instructions332284/utw8ql6y.jpg)

1. [] In a new browser tab, connect to +++http://@lab.Variable(MigratedIP):8080/airsonic+++.

1. [] Login using +++admin+++ for the username and +++admin+++ for the password.

1. [] Verify that the playlist that you created prior to the migration appears on the left side.

	>[!Note] You are now connected to the airsonic application on the VM that was migrated to Azure. That application is connected to the PGSQL database that you migrated previously.

1. [] Close the airsonic browser tab.

<!-- 3. To review additional steps to take after the migration has finished, review the [Complete the migration](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/migrate/tutorial-migrate-hyper-v?view=migrate-classic&tabs=UI#complete-the-migration) documentation, along with the post-migration best practices found in the same document. -->

#### Congratulations! 
You stopped replication to clean up migration state and validated the migrated VM's functionality by successfully accessing the application in Azure.

===

# Summary

In this lab you planned and executed a full Azure Migrate workflow for a small Linux application environment and then transitioned the migrated workload into steady-state operations.

You started by creating an Azure Migrate project and registering the Azure Migrate appliance to discover on-premises Hyper-V virtual machines and their workloads. After discovery completed, you reviewed the discovered inventory and grouped related components into an application so you could evaluate the stack as a unit. You then built a business case and reviewed the automatically generated assessment to compare modernization paths (PaaS-preferred, PaaS-only, and lift-and-shift). Using assessment outputs, you created a wave plan to organize the migration sequence and documented an identity mapping strategy from FreeIPA to Microsoft Entra ID.

Next, you performed migrations:
- You migrated the PostgreSQL backend to **Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server**, validated the migration, and updated the application configuration to point to the new database endpoint.
- You migrated the Airsonic frontend by lift-and-shift to an **Azure VM**, validated application functionality, and confirmed the application successfully connected to the migrated database.

At this point, you have:
- A documented plan and assessment-driven decision trail (business case → assessment → wave plan).
- A working migrated application stack (VM + PaaS database).
